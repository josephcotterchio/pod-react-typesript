# REACT + TYPESCRIPT (POD TOPIC)

DAY 1 of 2

We're going to start building a React + Typescript application from scratch, as
a pod. We will spend 3 days on it as a pod. Today is day 1 of 3.

Start building a simple Todo application. Create a public, shared Github repo.
We will create a simple full stack application with `react`, `typescript` and
`ts-node`

Here are the requirements:

* The application is built with `react`, `typescript` and `ts-node`
* The application is built in a single repo.
* The application does not need a database. It will forget all notes when it is
  restarted. In other words, save the data in a variable on the server.
* As a user, I can create a new note.
* As a user, I can read all existing notes
* As a user, I can update an existing note
* As a user, I can delete an existing note.

This will be a collaborative exercise in side the #assignments tab.
